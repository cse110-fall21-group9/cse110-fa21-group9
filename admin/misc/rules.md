## 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

  We will use [Slack](http://cse110-fa21-group9.slack.com) for communication and everyone needs to respond to messages on Slack within 24 hours  
  
## 3) Scheduling Meetings

  Our group meetings times will be decided by [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?13215422-O6V4p) and we will post group meetings in Google Calendar. 
  We will also alert members for meetings times through the Slack #scheduling channel. For emergency meetings that exist separately from 1. the scheduled weekly meetings and 2. extra meetings between individual team members, the team will do its utmost to provide advance notice of approximately _**48**_ hours or more.
   
## 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

  This element of the team working agreement is the list of rules/agreements or the contract that all members agree to live by.  
- Completed the tasks you were assigned on time
- Attend weekly meetings and communicate beforehand (at least 24 hours prior) if you cannot attend (on the attendance slack channel)
     - _**If more than half the team (4 people) cannot attend, then we will move the meeting using a when2meet to decide on the time.**_  

## 5) Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines (TBD)

  The roles and responsibilities of each team member are to be decided.
  
## 6) Conflict Resolution

- If you are having difficulty completing your tasks by the deadline, communicate that with teammates as soon as possible and ask for help.
- If you have a disagreement/conflicts with another team member, discuss with that team member as soon as possible to resolve your conflict.
     - _**If you feel uncomfortable, bring the issue to the team leader/TA**_

## 7) Expectations of Faculty and GTAâ€™s

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
