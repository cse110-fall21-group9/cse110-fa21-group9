# Onboard Notes

We all separately record what they did on the project, what they are proud of and what they feel they could improve upon or address beyond the class

### Discuss about how to access your repo, a tour of the repo organization and a demonstration of making a small change to the repo and the completion of the build process
- Demonstrate our repo
- One of us demonstrates a small change to the repo and how the build process works
- Talk about project board, github actions

### Agile practices that were conducted:
- Weekly briefs by the projects lead, to make sure everyone was on the same page
- Conducted Daily Standups on slack
- Held weekly meetings to talk about next steps for the development of our project. 
- Iterative Development (SCRUM)
- Use professional tools (GitHub projects and issues to stay organized and have a single source of information)
- 
### Challenges faced as a team:
- Communication between subgroups
> Miscommunicatioon and disagreement on architecture and organizing decision
> Conflicts in frontend/backend commuication

- Assignment of tasks to be completed
> We have few members, each person has to do a lot of stuff so there was conflicts on what people should do and on collaboration

- RESOLVED:
> More frequent meeting during the week
> Use Github Issues and Projects to stay on track
> Post Notes on architecture decision in SLACK

### Victories achieved as a team:
Achieved all of our deadlines in a timely manner. Finish building our app that met all the goals we identified in the beginning:
**GOAL**: Creating Recipe Management/Virtual Cookbook Application for home cooks so that they can save and manage their recipes in one place and get support when it comes to using these recipes for cooking

### Things we should have/wanted to do
- Kitchen timer
- Advanced search & filter by tag, ingredients, etc.
- Encoding images in JSON so that import/export works out of the box with images
- Global edit mode (select multiple recipes and delete, favourite, export in a separate mode)
