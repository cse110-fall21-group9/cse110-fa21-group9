###  Joshua Singer [@jjsinger11](https://github.com/jjsinger11):
      Hi, I'm Josh! When I'm not coding, I love to surf and skate with my friends. I'm so glad I came to San Diego, because the beaches
      are so nice and it's always warm here. In my free time, I love to explore new places on my bike and I've made it my mission to
      see all of San Deigo on it before I leave. If you see me around, just say hi!

###  Reshab Mehta [@Reshab18](https://github.com/Reshab18):
