# ADR - 003: API Usage

* Status: Live, this document is to be updated as more APIs surface.
* Date: 11/7/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Given our new MVP statement, what APIs should we be using to facilitate the more difficult features? In particular, we should be paying attention to:
1. Webscraping vs. Existing databases
2. Format of information retrieval
3. Monetization policies
4. Overall effectiveness

## Decision Drivers 

* The new form of our app is a cookbook with minimal sharing & searching options.
* In particular, we are concerned with importing/exporting recipes and 
* What kind of APIs can help us accomplish our objectives?

## Considered Options

1. EDAMAM
2. Spoonacular

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: EDAMAM. Awaiting input of API & Backend developers to elaborate.
