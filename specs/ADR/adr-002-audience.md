# ADR - 002: Target Audience

* Status: Accepted, proceeding with development as planned
* Date: 11/1/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Given our new MVP statement, what people should we be targeting as our primary audience?

## Decision Drivers 

* The new form of our app is a cookbook with minimal sharing & searching options. What kind of user is this app amenable to?

## Considered Options

1. Home Cooks
2. College Students
3. Professional Chefs

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: home cooks. This is the most amenable to our MVP statement, which is more like a digital cookbook than a recipe browser. It best supports those who already have recipes that need to be kept in a concise record-book, and also who want to exchange recipes with their friends. This feature-set fits the home cook demographic neatly.

### Positive Consequences 

* Our view of our target audience becomes clearer. Moreover, we have a better idea of what our app should look like: 
  * no-nonsense
  * to-the-point
  * not replete with silly colloquialisms to grab the attention of the average person in our age group.

### Negative Consequences

* Few to speak of.
