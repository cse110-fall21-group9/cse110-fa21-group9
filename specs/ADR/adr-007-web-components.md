# ADR - 005: Web Components

* Status: Live
* Date: 11/11/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to ensure that the architecture of our software system is robust, our SPA will need to be composed of mostly web-components.  
Which ones will we need, and how will they be structured?

## Decision Drivers

* Refer to our Wireframes and Control Flow diagrams to determine what elements are good candidates for conversion to web-components.

## Considered Options

1. Recipe Cards
2. The recipe-view page
3. The recipe-compose/update form
4. Kitchen timer

## Decision Outcome

All of the above will be prototyped and eventually converted into web components, which will then be integrated into our application.
